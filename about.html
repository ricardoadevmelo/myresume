            <p>
              Hello, I'm Ricardo Alves Melo, a technology enthusiast with a
              passion for continuous learning. I’m currently improving my
              English at Icot College and deepening my knowledge in Systems
              Analysis and Development, focusing on front-end development as I
              pursue a career transition into tech. My professional journey has
              been diverse and enriching. Over the years, I’ve worked as a
              salesperson, sales representative, and store manager in
              construction materials and agricultural products. I also practiced
              law and served in the public sector, working as an advisor and
              judge assistant at the Brazilian Court of Justice. Today, my path
              has led me to Ireland, where I work in customer service in Cork, a
              vibrant city that has become my home.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>My Interests</strong> <br />
              Beyond technology, I have a deep love for outdoor activities and
              sports that challenge me. Weight training, rappelling,
              sandboarding, snowboarding, and surfing are part of my lifestyle.
              I also enjoy exploring new cultures, visiting historical sites,
              and traveling to new destinations. My journey has already taken me
              to incredible places like Norway, Sweden, Scotland, and now, I'm
              experiencing life in Cork, Ireland. Whether in the pursuit of new
              professional challenges or exploring the world around me, I'm
              always moving forward, learning, and evolving.
            </p>
